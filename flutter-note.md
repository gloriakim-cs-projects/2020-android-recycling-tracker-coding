## Coding Tips

- Always use a single quote
- 'alt'+'Enter'
- hot reload: stless + 'ctrl + s'
- hot reset: test from start
- `container` without child (ONLY ONE IS ALLOWED): trying to be as big as possible + with child: shrinks to the size of children (such as text)
- `SafeArea`: allows to put everything inside of bumpy designs of phone
- `padding` = inside of container
- `margin` = outside of container
- create a container with infinite length to shift containers to the right
- list of variables(?):'ctrl' + 'q'

- `stateless` = do not change VS `stateful` = change
