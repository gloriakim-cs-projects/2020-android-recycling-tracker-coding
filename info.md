- AEROSOL CAN (EMPTY) // 스프레이 캔
1. Aerosol cans are made of highly recyclable steel, similar to a can of Campbell's soup with one important difference. Aerosol cans' contents are under pressure. That's where recycling them gets tricky. 
Aerosol cans need to be completely empty to be sent safely through the recycling process because pressurized gas can explode if crushed during transport or at the sorting facility. Aerosol gasses are flammable as well so be sure to use up all the contents before recycling.  
From https://www.recyclebycity.com/chicago/brief/can-i-recycle-aerosol-cans
2. The process for recycling full aerosol cans is simple. Using special equipment, a worker punches a hole in the can and allows any remaining liquid to drain out. The liquid is kept in a secure container so it can be disposed of properly. The empty metal can is sent to a metal recycler. 
from https://recyclenation.com/2014/04/recycle-aerosol-cans/

- AEROSOL CAN (FULL OR PARTIALLY FULL)

- ANIMAL WASTE & BEDDING
1. Contaminated bedding should be disposed of as chemical, radioactive, or medical waste, based on the contaminant.  Uncontaminated animal bedding can be disposed of as general waste.  Uncontaminated bedding could potentially be composted or used as landscape mulch. 
From: https://www.orf.od.nih.gov/EnvironmentalProtection/WasteDisposal/Pages/AnimalBedding.aspx

- ANTIFREEZE

- ASEPTIC CARTON // 네모난 우유곽
1. Aseptic boxes, also known as drink boxes,  70 percent paper (used for stiffness and strength), 24 percent polyethylene (used in four different layers to seal the package tightly) and 6 percent aluminum foil (used as a barrier against air and light). The long paper fibers found in aseptic boxes and milk cartons are valuable. However, because of handling problems caused by liquid residue in the packages, only three American paper mills use these products as a raw material. End-products from these mills include printing and writing paper, tissue, and paper towels.
from https://www.waste360.com/mag/waste_profiles_garbage_aseptic
2. Aseptic boxes are hydropulped to separate paper fibers from plastic and aluminum foil. Because graphics are printed on the outer polyethylene layer, the paper fiber does not require deinking. The plastic can be burned for steam at a paper mill. If local markets exist, the plastic-foil mix can be used for plastic lumber.

- BEVERAGE BOTTLE (PLASTIC) **REVieW**
1. Most recycling programs ask that you rinse your bottles and jugs before recycling. The remnants often contain sugar, which will attract insects and generate odors.
You’ll want to check with your local program whether to keep caps on the bottles, or whether caps are accepted at all. Some programs want the cap on to prevent loose caps from falling out during transportation. Others want the cap off to ensure the bottle is empty and because their recycling machinery may be damaged when trying to crush a capped bottle.
You should be OK leaving the label on the bottle, but it’s unlikely to be recycled since it’s a low-grade quality of paper or plastic.
from https://earth911.com/recycling-guide/how-to-recycle-plastic-jugs-bottles/
2. Recycling centers use optical scanners to identify the type of plastic resin, so #1 and #2 plastics are separated from each other and other materials (such as paper and glass). Bottles are then crushed (where caps are removed if you haven’t already done so) and baled to be sent to a plastic recycler.
Recyclers will shred the #1 or #2 plastic into flakes, which are washed, rinsed and dried. Flakes are then melted into pellets, then transported to a manufacturer to make new plastic bottles/jugs or other products, such as lining for sleeping bags, T-shirts, carpet, or playground equipment.

BEVERAGE CAN (METAL) **NOTE: aluminum?**
1. Aluminium can be recycled forever because when it melted down and reformed, it does not lose any quality, so the process can be repeated over and over again.  Recycling aluminium saves around 95% of the energy needed to make the metal from raw materials.
from https://alupro.org.uk/consumers/why-is-recycling-aluminium-so-important/#:~:text=Aluminium%20can%20be%20recycled%20forever,the%20metal%20from%20raw%20materials.
2. When you send your empty beverage can to the recycling center it is combined with other aluminum cans in a holding area. After there is enough for a truckload the cans are crushed and shaped into a large bale. The bales are sent to the aluminum recyclers where the cans are shredded into tiny pieces. These are then heated into molten aluminum along with thousands of other cans and are formed into an ingot.
from http://www.dwswa.org/recycle-reuse-articles/2016/5/12/how-aluminum-beverage-cans-are-recycled#:~:text=After%20there%20is%20enough%20for,are%20formed%20into%20an%20ingot.

BOTTLE (GLASS)
0. (procedure) You can leave the label/foil on, but many recyclers will ask you to separate the metal caps. This is partly to ensure that all liquids are removed. Remove all wine corks.
1. Glass does not lose their quality over time, so it can be recycled infinitely with no loss in purity. However, since there is no market for recycling broken glass, it can no longer be recycled once it is broken.
2. At a materials recovery facility, glass is separated from other materials like metal and paper, then sent to a glass processor. It’s sorted by color and any contaminants are removed. The glass is then crushed into small pieces called cullet, which is heated to 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit and molded into new glass containers.

BOX (CARDBOARD)
0. instruction: Use a knife or scissors to cut any tape used to seal the top and/or bottom of the box, then collapse the box. You don’t need to remove the tape, but most recyclers prefer that boxes are flattened to save space.

For boxes that contained huge items, you may need to fold or cut the flattened box in half for it to fit in your recycling cart. Some programs also allow you to set large boxes next to the cart, but don’t put them out if it’s raining. Wet cardboard doesn’t have a recycling market.

For boxes that are food-soiled (such as pizza boxes), cut out any oil stains before recycling. Food-soiled paper doesn’t have a recycling market.
https://earth911.com/recycling-guide/how-to-recycle-cardboard/
1. Over half of the cardboard collected is used to make new cardboard boxes, and additional cardboard can be downcycled into paperboard (used for cereal boxes) or chipboard (used for shoeboxes)
