AEROSOL CAN (EMPTY) // 스프레이 캔

1. Do your best to use up all the product inside. If the can still has product inside, even if it’s nonhazardous product like whipped cream, your recycling program will not accept it. The easiest way to make sure it’s empty is to shake the can and listen for liquid inside, or spray until nothing comes out.
Most aerosol cans come with a plastic cap, which should be removed and recycled separately. Visit our recycling guide on plastic caps for more information.
DO NOT puncture a hole in the can to remove any remaining product, as the can will explode and hurt you. You should also not attempt to remove the spray nozzle on top of the can.
Verify whether your community accepts aerosol cans with other metal cans, or whether they are classified as household hazardous waste (HHW). There are separate disposal options for each.

1-1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAmAL9VsM2A
2. The process for recycling full aerosol cans is simple. Using special equipment, a worker punches a hole in the can and allows any remaining liquid to drain out. The liquid is kept in a secure container so it can be disposed of properly. The empty metal can is sent to a metal recycler. 
from https://recyclenation.com/2014/04/recycle-aerosol-cans/
3. Aerosol cans are made of highly recyclable steel, similar to a can of Campbell's soup with one important difference. Aerosol cans' contents are under pressure. That's where recycling them gets tricky. 
Aerosol cans need to be completely empty to be sent safely through the recycling process because pressurized gas can explode if crushed during transport or at the sorting facility. Aerosol gasses are flammable as well so be sure to use up all the contents before recycling.

ANTIFREEZE

3. Antifreeze may contain heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, and chromium in high enough levels to make it a regulated hazardous waste, so it should be treated as a regulated hazardous waste rather than a trash. If recycled in facilities, most antifreeze is put back to use treatment as antifreeze. Automotive shops can recycle it on site using specialized machinery. The machines remove the heavy metals and any oil that has made its way into the liquid, and then add chemicals to keep the ethylene glycol from breaking down.

ASEPTIC CARTON // 네모난 우유곽

0. Aseptic cartons, which are made of layered paper, aluminum foil and plastic, are often packaged with juice, chicken broth, soup, non-dairy milk and many other.
https://thegrocerystoreguy.com/are-aseptic-containers-recyclable/#:~:text=Aseptic%20cartons%2C%20which%20are%20made,be%20mailed%20to%20recycling%20centers.
0-1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Yavzu_e4g
1. Be sure to remove any lids, straws, or fancy extras that come with your packaging. They go in the garbage. Recycle only empty cartons. Rinsing isn’t required for recycling them, but it does help ensure that the container is empty, as well as help reduce potential odor or pest issues in the recyclables. It is not necessary to flatten your cartons and, in fact, it can slow the recycling process. 
https://earth911.com/home-garden/recycling-mystery-milk-and-juice-cartons/
2. Typically, its journey begins at a materials recovery facility where it gets separated from other waste and types of recyclables.

From there, the cartons are shipped to paper mills where they are mixed with water in a giant blender called a hydra-pulper. This process separates the paper from the plastic and aluminum. Once separation is complete, the paper fiber is ready to be transformed into new products such as tissues, office paper, and even building materials depending on the area of the country and the mill.

The plastic and aluminum materials are collected from the hydra-pulping process as well. The plastic, when re-purposed separately, is often used for shipping crates and building materials. However, in North America, it is often left in a combined state with the aluminum, creating a material called a poly/al mix. The poly/al mix has a limited secondary use market, but some mills have been able to use it to generate energy for their facilities.
https://earth911.com/home-garden/recycling-mystery-milk-and-juice-cartons/
ANOTHER SOURCE: 
Aseptic boxes are hydropulped to separate paper fibers from plastic and aluminum foil. Because graphics are printed on the outer polyethylene layer, the paper fiber does not require deinking. The plastic can be burned for steam at a paper mill. If local markets exist, the plastic-foil mix can be used for plastic lumber.
https://www.waste360.com/mag/waste_profiles_garbage_aseptic

3. The long paper fibers found in aseptic boxes and milk cartons are valuable. End-products from these mills include printing and writing paper, tissue, and paper towels.

BAG (PLASTIC)
1. Remove anything inside the bags, such as receipts, stickers, or crumbs. All these items will contaminate your bag load.
Keep a bag collection bin in your house, such as one big garbage bag for all bags. Since they compact easily, you should be able to fit 50 to 100 plastic bags in one garbage bag.
Make sure any bags you are recycling have a #2 or #4 plastic symbol on them. If not, you can’t be sure what plastic resin the bag is made from, so you’ll want to reuse it instead, before eventually throwing it away.

2.  Plastic bag recycling involves chipping the bags into pellets. While pellets can then be reprocessed into new bags, they will most likely be shipped to a company like Trex to be manufactured into plastic lumber. 
https://earth911.com/recycling-guide/how-to-recycle-plastic-bags/#:~:text=Plastic%20Bag%20Recycling%20Process,be%20manufactured%20into%20plastic%20lumber.

3. Typically made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE, number 2 plastic) or low-density polyethylene (LDPE, number 4 plastic), plastic bags and other soft plastics are difficult to recycle because of their form. Plastic bags are lightweight and can easily get blown to places they don’t belong, and because they’re thin and flexible, they have a tendency to get snagged or tangled in machinery. So it's important to recycle them not in most curbside recycling bins but in collection bins in your local grocery stores.
https://livegreen.recyclebank.com/column/because-you-asked/can-i-recycle-plastic-grocery-bags-in-the-recycling-bin

BAKED GOODS (CAN BE USED FOR ALL FOOD ITEMS)

3. While food residue gets burned away during the recycling process for plastic, glass, and metal, the same can’t be said for paper. When paper is recycled, it is mixed with water to form slurry. Oil and fat from food residue don’t mix with water; instead, they float on top of the slurry and mingle with the paper pulp. Oily pulp makes very poor quality paper and is, in effect, unusable.
In single-stream recycling communities, all accepted materials go in the same recycling bin together. This creates the risk of grease or food residue transferring from a plastic, metal, or glass container (which is technically fine to recycle even if it has residue on it) to paper materials (which cannot be recycled if it has residue on it). It’s best to avoid any possible cross-contamination by rinsing soiled recyclables and keeping all food residues out of the bin.
The biggest reason to keep grease and food residue out of the recycling technically isn’t a recycling issue at all! It’s a sanitary one. Food residue spoils, which can create unsafe conditions for workers in recycling facilities. Prevent mold and bacteria from growing on your recyclables by rinsing them before you put them in the bin.

BAKING TRAY (ALUMINUM) (SAME FOR ALUMINUM FOIL!)

1. To recycle your aluminum foil and trays, simply give them a quick rinse after use and place them directly in your curbside recycling container. 
https://www.dakotavalleyrecycling.org/curbside/quick-guide-how-to-recycle-aluminum-foil#:~:text=Did%20you%20know%20that%20aluminum,waste%20which%20can%20contaminate%20collection.

2. Once aluminums are collected from your recycling bins, they are sent to the aluminum recyclers where the aluminums are shredded into tiny pieces. These are then heated into molten aluminum along with thousands of other cans and are formed into an ingot.
http://www.dwswa.org/recycle-reuse-articles/2016/5/12/how-aluminum-beverage-cans-are-recycled#:~:text=Aluminum%20is%20a%20resilient%20metal,recycled%20over%20and%20over%20again.&text=The%20bales%20are%20sent%20to,are%20formed%20into%20an%20ingot.

3. Aluminium can be recycled foreve because can be melted down and reformed without losing any quality, so the process can be repeated over and over again. Besides, recycling aluminium saves around 95% of the energy needed to make the metal from raw materials.
https://alupro.org.uk/consumers/why-is-recycling-aluminium-so-important/

BALL (TRASH)
3. Most exercise balls are made of vinyl, which is not easily recycled. (More precisely, the balls are commonly made from a soft and elastic polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cover that's inflated with air. PVC contains a high volume of chlorine, and often phthalates as well. However, it is difficult to recycle PVC because of the high cost of recycling PVC, not to mention the toxic fumes that can be released when it is reprocessed, so the material is not accepted at most recycling centers.) Instead, sporting goods manufacturers may have take-back programs and accept old exercise balls for reprocessing such as this!!!!!!: https://www.recycleballs.org/solution/  !!!!!!!!!
https://homeguides.sfgate.com/exercise-balls-recyclable-79390.html

BALLOONS
3. The two primary types of balloons made and sold in the U.S. are latex and Mylar. Both materials cannot be re-melted or dissolved in solvents easily, so they are generally considered non-recyclable. If you put used balloons in the trash, they’ll end up in landfills, where latex balloons will eventually biodegrade (because they’re made from the sap of a rubber tree), meaning that f they are released in the air, they will break down over time. However, Mylar balloons will never biodegrade (because they are made of a type of plastic). So for Mylar ballons, it is highly recommended to give a second life.

BARBEQUE (refer to FOOD)

BARBEQUE GRILL
1. ***TRASH/RECYCLIN INSTRUCTION***
If you have a gas grill, your first concern is the propane tank. Propane tanks are a hazardous waste; in some states, they are banned from landfills and many local communities have additional regulations regarding their disposal. The dealer where you obtained the gas will usually accept empty tanks for recycling. Even if they don’t, they can probably advise you of local laws and disposal options. If you are dealing with a very old grill, you might need to deliver the tank to the local fire department for safe handling.

Once you have dealt with the propane tank, some communities will allow you to dispose of the rest of the grill as trash. In many places, you will only be able to recycle your grill if you break it down yourself. Many barbecues are also stealth electronics — household items containing electrical components that require special handling. Ignition wires, thermometers, electric controllers, and batteries are all e-waste that should not go in your garbage.

Plastic side shelves marked with a recycling symbol and plastic wheels are recyclable if your community recycles plastics. But don’t assume these pieces can go in your curbside recycling bin. Call your local waste company to confirm where you can recycle these plastics. Most other plastic components, such as knobs and handles, are garbage. The propane hose is also currently unrecyclable.

Gas valves are usually made of recyclable brass or aluminum. Metal casters, grill lids, shelves and the grill body are usually recyclable as scrap metal. This is true even if they are rusted.
https://earth911.com/home-garden/recycling-mystery-barbecue-grill/#:~:text=Call%20your%20local%20waste%20company,you%20can%20recycle%20these%20plastics.&text=Gas%20valves%20are%20usually%20made,even%20if%20they%20are%20rusted.

ANOTHER ONE: https://www.charbroil.com/learn/how-to-dispose-and-recycle-your-old-gas-grill/ <<<- maybe include some numbering for recycling step / part?

3. A short answer is because a barbeque grill is too big to go into the recycling machinary and is made of many components that are hard to separate into pieces.

1. Aseptic boxes, also known as drink boxes,  70 percent paper (used for stiffness and strength), 24 percent polyethylene (used in four different layers to seal the package tightly) and 6 percent aluminum foil (used as a barrier against air and light). The long paper fibers found in aseptic boxes and milk cartons are valuable. However, because of handling problems caused by liquid residue in the packages, only three American paper mills use these products as a raw material. End-products from these mills include printing and writing paper, tissue, and paper towels.

- BEVERAGE BOTTLE (PLASTIC) **REVieW**
1. Most recycling programs ask that you rinse your bottles and jugs before recycling. The remnants often contain sugar, which will attract insects and generate odors.
You’ll want to check with your local program whether to keep caps on the bottles, or whether caps are accepted at all. Some programs want the cap on to prevent loose caps from falling out during transportation. Others want the cap off to ensure the bottle is empty and because their recycling machinery may be damaged when trying to crush a capped bottle.
You should be OK leaving the label on the bottle, but it’s unlikely to be recycled since it’s a low-grade quality of paper or plastic.
from https://earth911.com/recycling-guide/how-to-recycle-plastic-jugs-bottles/
2. Recycling centers use optical scanners to identify the type of plastic resin, so #1 and #2 plastics are separated from each other and other materials (such as paper and glass). Bottles are then crushed (where caps are removed if you haven’t already done so) and baled to be sent to a plastic recycler.
Recyclers will shred the #1 or #2 plastic into flakes, which are washed, rinsed and dried. Flakes are then melted into pellets, then transported to a manufacturer to make new plastic bottles/jugs or other products, such as lining for sleeping bags, T-shirts, carpet, or playground equipment.

BEVERAGE CAN (METAL) **NOTE: aluminum?**
1. Aluminium can be recycled forever because when it melted down and reformed, it does not lose any quality, so the process can be repeated over and over again.  Recycling aluminium saves around 95% of the energy needed to make the metal from raw materials.
from https://alupro.org.uk/consumers/why-is-recycling-aluminium-so-important/#:~:text=Aluminium%20can%20be%20recycled%20forever,the%20metal%20from%20raw%20materials.
2. When you send your empty beverage can to the recycling center it is combined with other aluminum cans in a holding area. After there is enough for a truckload the cans are crushed and shaped into a large bale. The bales are sent to the aluminum recyclers where the cans are shredded into tiny pieces. These are then heated into molten aluminum along with thousands of other cans and are formed into an ingot.

0. (procedure) You can leave the label/foil on, but many recyclers will ask you to separate the metal caps. This is partly to ensure that all liquids are removed. Remove all wine corks.
1. Glass does not lose their quality over time, so it can be recycled infinitely with no loss in purity. However, since there is no market for recycling broken glass, it can no longer be recycled once it is broken.
2. At a materials recovery facility, glass is separated from other materials like metal and paper, then sent to a glass processor. It’s sorted by color and any contaminants are removed. The glass is then crushed into small pieces called cullet, which is heated to 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit and molded into new glass containers.

BOX (CARDBOARD)
0. instruction: Use a knife or scissors to cut any tape used to seal the top and/or bottom of the box, then collapse the box. You don’t need to remove the tape, but most recyclers prefer that boxes are flattened to save space.

For boxes that contained huge items, you may need to fold or cut the flattened box in half for it to fit in your recycling cart. Some programs also allow you to set large boxes next to the cart, but don’t put them out if it’s raining. Wet cardboard doesn’t have a recycling market.

For boxes that are food-soiled (such as pizza boxes), cut out any oil stains before recycling. Food-soiled paper doesn’t have a recycling market.

1. Over half of the cardboard collected is used to make new cardboard boxes, and additional cardboard can be downcycled into paperboard (used for cereal boxes) or chipboard (used for shoeboxes)
