Erasers are made of rubbers, which cannot be recycled. Plus, erasers are so small that they can be stuck inside of recycling machines. So, it's a better idea to simply throw it into a trashcan, or donate them in here: (URL)

# Tips I learned

When `main.dart` is not connected, do the following:
(1) File -> Project Structure -> Module
(2) Add the root folder of the project (then it will detect that its a flutter app again)
(3) Build again
